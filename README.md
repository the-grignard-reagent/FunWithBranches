# Fun With Branches 😉
Welcome Guys & Gals to the repository, where you will be completing your Task 2️⃣ of FOSS Workshop.
<br>
<br>
We have divided the Task 2, into 3️⃣ subtasks, and the points will be awarded accordingly.

## Sub-Task 1
You will find a folder, named as <i>Subtask-1</i> in the <b>main</b> branch of this repository. In that folder, you have to create a text file the  name of which will be your <b>Github Username</b>.  
In that text file, you have to answer the following things :
- Your Full Name
- Your Nick Name (or something, you would like to be known as)
- Your Hometown & Homestate 😂
- What are you most excited to learn in the APK Month?
- What all societies do you want to be a part of during your 4 years of college life?
- The Course you Hate the Most
- Github Profile URL
- Facebook Profile URL
- Instagram Profile URL
  
You will find a sample text file in that folder for your reference. Once you have answered all these ❓, you just have to save the file, and push it to the <b>main</b> branch.

## Format of Commit Message

## What to do after Pushing?
Once you have pushed your changes, make sure to make a PR(Pull Request) in the main branch. Once you have done that, give yourself a pat on your back, for completing Subtask-1, and proceed to the branch <b>Subtask-2</b>, for further instructions.
