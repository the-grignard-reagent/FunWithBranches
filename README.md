# Fun With Branches 😉
Welcome Guys & Gals, to the branch <b>Subtask-3</b>. Here, you will be completing your Subtask-3.

## Sub-Task 3
In this branch you will find a text file named <b>Subtask-3.txt</b>. In that file, you have to add the following things :
- The initials of your favorite Third Year Senior, mind you, only the initials.
- 2 reasons why do you like Him or Her

Now while doing this subtask, you will be facing <i>Merge Conflicts</i>, and hence will be asked again & again, to solve merge conflicts, until your PR is merged.  
Also, you can find some sample entries in the text file for your Reference.
